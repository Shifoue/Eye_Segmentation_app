        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
            This is a proof of concept about Eye Segmentation and the methods used.<br />
            The model was trained on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset">CelebFaces</a> Kaggle's dataset and achieved 89,5% <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indice_de_S%C3%B8rensen-Dice">Dice Score</a> on the test set.<br />
            In order to train the model, I created a train set of 800 images and a validation set of 200 images. I also created a test set of 1000 images to evaluate the model's performance.<br />
            Then I created the associated masks using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/">Mediapipe</a>. It allowed me to approximate eye position by applying mesh on the faces. Even though the results are great on the test set, we could achieve better generalization by using another more precisely annotated dataset.<br />
            I recommend using a dataset that includes various types of face pictures, rather than just close-up shots. This could significantly improve the generalization of the model on different face inputs.<br />
            The current model doesn't generalize well because of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset">CelebFaces</a> dataset's limitation.<br />
        </p>

        <h2>Explanations</h2>
        <p>
            This demonstration aims to showcase the results of the technical choices I made on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset">CelebFaces Kaggle Dataset</a> and the generalization capabilities of the methods used.<br />
            For example the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indice_de_S%C3%B8rensen-Dice">Dice Score</a> loss is a great solution against bad learning strategies, enforcing a focus on the segmented part instead of falling into a white pixel only strategy.<br />
            This loss could be applied to other higher quality datasets allowing the model to achieve even better results on those datasets.<br />

        <h2>Upload a Face picture</h2>
        <p>
            If you wish to test the model, feel free to upload a picture zoomed on the face, otherwise the model won't be able to predict the position of the eyes.<br />
            Rest assured, I do not save any uploaded picture to the server. I use a base64 manipulation to display the image without saving it.
