        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
            <b class="term">This is a proof of concept about Eye Segmentation and the methods used</b>.<br />
            <br />
            <b class="term">The model was trained on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset">CelebFaces</a> Kaggle's dataset and achieved 89,5% <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indice_de_S%C3%B8rensen-Dice">Dice Score</a> on the test set</b>.<br />
            In order to train the model, I created a train set of 800 images and a validation set of 200 images. I also created a test set of 1000 images to evaluate the model's performance.<br />
            Then <b class="term">I created the associated masks using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/">Mediapipe</a></b>. It allowed me to approximate eye position by applying mesh on the faces. Although the test set results are excellent, we could improve generalization by utilizing a dataset with more diversity.<br />
            I recommend using a dataset that includes various types of face pictures, rather than just close-up shots. This could significantly improve the generalization of the model on different face inputs.<br />
            The current model doesn't generalize well to all types of face pictures because of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset">CelebFaces</a> dataset's limitations.<br />
        </p>

        <h2>Explanations</h2>
        <p>
            <b class="term">This demonstration aims to showcase the results of the technical choices I made on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset">CelebFaces</a> Kaggle's dataset and the generalization capabilities of the methods used</b>.<br />
            <b class="term">To ensure a robust learning strategy for the model, I implemented a <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indice_de_S%C3%B8rensen-Dice">Dice Score</a> loss. This approach effectively counters poor strategies, such as predicting only white pixels, by focusing solely on the segmented parts of the image.</b>.<br />
            <b class="term">Applying this loss function to higher quality datasets could enable the model to achieve even better results</b>.<br />

        <h2>Upload a Face picture</h2>
        <p>
            If you wish to test the model, feel free to upload a picture zoomed on the face, otherwise the model won't be able to predict the position of the eyes.<br />
            <b class="term">Rest assured, I do not save any uploaded picture to the server</b>. I use a base64 manipulation to display the image without saving it.
