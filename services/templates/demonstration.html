    <title>Identity picture segmentation</title>
        <h1>Face segmentation</h1>
        <p>
            The model has been trained on approximated masks from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset">CelebFaces Kaggle Dataset</a>, containing 218x178 face images. It achieved 85% <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indice_de_S%C3%B8rensen-Dice">Dice Score</a> on the test set.<br />
            I used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/">Mediapipe</a> to approximate the eye positions on the faces and I used this information to create the masks that I use as truth. Even though the results are great on the test set, we could gain precision by using a more precisely annotated dataset.<br />
            The current model is limited to face images only and doesn't generalize well to other type of pictures. This could be solved by adding more picture types to the dataset, such as full-body pictures for example.<br />

        <h2>Demonstration : Upload a Face picture</h2>
        <p>
            This demonstration aims to showcase the results of the technical choices I made on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset">CelebFaces Kaggle Dataset</a> and the generalization capabilities of the methods I used to other higher quality datasets for better results.<br />

            If you wish to test the model, feel free to upload a picture zoomed on the face, otherwise the model won't be able to predict the position of the eyes.<br />
            Rest assured, I do not save any uploaded picture to the server. I use a base64 manipulation to display the image without saving it.
